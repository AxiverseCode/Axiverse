# Axiverse Engine

For additional information, please visit the [wiki](https://github.com/AxiverseCode/Axiverse/wiki).

This is a game and simulation engine with both client side components and server side simulation
components. We focus on ease of use and development as well as being extensible for a wide range
of applications. This engine is meant to be used to build a space simulation sandbox game along the
line of [Eve Online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdoQzmzg2XY) and features will be prioritized
in such a way.
